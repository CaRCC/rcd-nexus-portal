## How to contribute to the RCD Nexus Portal

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/CaRCC/rcd-nexus-portal/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/CaRCC/rcd-nexus-portal/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **screen shot** if necessary to show the unexpected behavior.

#### **Do you want to suggest an enhancement or new feature?**

* **Ensure your ideas has not already been suggested** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/CaRCC/rcd-nexus-portal/issues). If you find an existing feature request that is fairly similar, feel free to comment on that existing issue. It is also fine to just upvote/endorse an existing request by adding a short comment of your interest and/or use-case. 

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing your suggestion, [open a new one](https://github.com/CaRCC/rcd-nexus-portal/issues/new?template=feature_request.md). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and any expected interactions with other existing features.

#### **Are you interested in contributing to a translation of one of the portal tools for another locale?**

* We have tried to make translations fairly straightforward, and would welcome your engagement to localize the tools for non-English speakers. Please email [capsmodel-help@carcc.org](mailto:capsmodel-help@carcc.org) or create an [enhancement Issue](https://github.com/CaRCC/rcd-nexus-portal/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) that includes your contact information so we can discuss how to proceed. 

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Please ensure that your contribution is consistent with the coding conventions in the existing codebase, and is well-documented.

#### **Do you have questions about the portal applications?**

* If you have any question about how to use the RCD Capabilities Assessment please share your questions with the working group by emailing [capsmodel-help@carcc.org](mailto:capsmodel-help@carcc.org). You are also welcome to join us for Office Hours; see the [Research Computing and Data Capabilities Model working group website](https://carcc.org/rcdcm/) for the schedule, or subscribe to the [capsmodel-discuss@carcc.org discussion list](https://groups.google.com/a/carcc.org/g/capsmodel-discuss) for announcements about this and more related activities.
