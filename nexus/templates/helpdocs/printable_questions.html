    <h1 class="title">RCD Capabilities Model v2.0 Questions by Facing</h1>
    <p class="content">
        This document includes the main text for the questions in each Facing, grouped by topic.<sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup>
        This is intended for use by institutions that are discussing who may contribute to an assessment using 
        the Research Computing and Data (RCD) Capabilities Model, and want to share the type of questions that will be asked.
    </p>
    <p class="content">The RCD Capabilities Model is organized into sections that reflect different roles that staff fill in supporting 
        Research Computing and Data, and are named to reflect <em>who</em> or <em>what</em>  role is &ldquo;facing&rdquo; 
        (i.e., focused on). Within each facing, the model poses questions about aspects of research computing and data for
        the associated role; the questions are grouped into Topics.
    </p>
    <p class="content">Larger organizations may have a team associated with each facing role, while smaller organizations may 
        have just a few people who cover these different roles. In filling out the assessment tool, you will likely want to involve people who work 
        in the different roles; they can work to fill out their respective section of the assessment.
